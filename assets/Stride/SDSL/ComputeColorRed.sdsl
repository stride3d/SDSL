// This is the simplest way of overriding particle shader behavior
//  Refer to the Red Particle System in the Editor
//  Under Material it uses a Shader for its Emissive color, and the shader's name is ComputeColorRed
//  As long as your shader inherits ComputeColor and overrides float4 Compute() you can add any custom behavior to it

shader ComputeColorRed : ComputeColor
{
    override float4 Compute()
    {
        return float4(1, 0, 0, 1);
    }
};
